\textbf{Mass Transport Problem} :\\
Transportation Simplex $->$ Earth Moving Distance\\
Network simplex algorithm (\textit{with block search pivoting ??}) from LEMON graph library $->$ general min-cost flow problems
Transportation simplex have worst case complexity in $O(n^3)$ but generally behaves in $O(n^2)$ in some context.\\

\noindent\textbf{Limitation} : Problem size $->$ cost matrix storage too heavy for GPU memory.
Presented method working for interpolation between two distributions, future work idea : interpolation between N distribution (texture mixing)

Radial basis function ?

\subsection*{Minimum-cost flow algorithms: An experimental evaluation}

\textbf{Minimum-cost flow algorithms in the LEMON library :}\\

\noindent\textbf{Spanning tree data structures} :\\
\noindent ATI (Augmented Threaded Index ) vs  XTI (eXtended Threaded Index ) XTI apparently have better performance for network simplex.\\
Additional improvement : a reverse thread index is also stored for each node to represent the depth-first traversal as a doubly-linked list.\\
For initialization of the initial spanning tree solution, adding an artificial root with additionnals arcs between the nodes and the new roots provides better performances.\\

\noindent\textbf{Pivot rules :}\\
\noindent simplest pivot rules : \textit{best eligible} and \textit{first eligible}.\\

\noindent\textit{block search pivot rule} : cyclically examines certain subsets (blocks) of the arcs and select best candidate at each iteration. Block size seems quite important parameter, set the size proportionally to $|A(G)|$ between 1\% and 10\%. Article experiments suggest $block\_size = \lfloor\sqrt{m}\rfloor$ with (m = $|A(G)|$, the number of arc in graph $G$)\\

\noindent\textit{candidate list pivot rule} : method that examines arcs and build a list of most eligible arcs. The list is then used for at most $K$ iterations. If an arc becomes non-eligible, it is removed from the list. Article suggest : $L = \lfloor\sqrt{m}/4\rfloor$ and $K = \lfloor L/10\rfloor$.\\

\noindent\textit{altering candidate list pivot rule} : improved version of \textit{candidate list pivot rule} presented in the article. It maintain a list of size $K$ of eligible arcs at each iteration, extending and removing arcs only searching in one arc block with size $B$. Article suggest $B = \lfloor\sqrt{m}\rfloor$ and $K = \lfloor B/100\rfloor$.
